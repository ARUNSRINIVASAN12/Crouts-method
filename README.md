# Crouts Method
This script essentially implements the LU decomposition method for solving a system of linear equations Ax = B:

Input: Read matrices A and B. \
Display: Show the initial system of equations. \
LU Decomposition: Solve for L and U matrices. \
Intermediate Solutions: Solve LY = B for Y. \
Final Solution: Solve UX = Y for X. \
The use of symbolic computation and roots functions here helps in simplifying the process of finding the decomposition.
